# Semitexa DI Container

Semitexa uses a **custom DI container** (no PHP-DI). It is built once per worker and follows the design in `var/docs/DESIGN_DI_CONTAINER.md`: only one way to register services and one way to inject.

## Who gets into the container

Only types registered via **#[AsServiceContract(of: SomeInterface::class)]** on implementation classes. The container discovers them through `ServiceContractRegistry` (same as `bin/semitexa contracts:list`). There is no separate “register anything” attribute: if a class is not an implementation of a contract with `AsServiceContract`, it is not in the container unless set manually for bootstrap (e.g. `Environment`).

- **Handlers:** implement `HandlerInterface` and use `#[AsServiceContract(of: HandlerInterface::class)]`.
- **Event listeners:** implement `EventListenerInterface` and use `#[AsServiceContract(of: EventListenerInterface::class)]`.
- **Other services:** define an interface and put `#[AsServiceContract(of: ThatInterface::class)]` on the implementation(s). Classes in `Semitexa\Core\` are treated as module `Core`.

Bootstrap entries (e.g. `Environment`) are registered in `ContainerFactory::registerBootstrapEntries()` with `$container->set()` before `build()`.

## How to inject (no constructor injection)

Dependencies are injected **only via protected properties** with exactly one of these attributes:

| Attribute            | Meaning |
|----------------------|--------|
| **#[InjectAsReadonly]** | Shared instance per worker (same for all requests). |
| **#[InjectAsMutable]**  | New clone per `get()`; then `RequestContext` (Request, Session, CookieJar) is injected into the clone. |
| **#[InjectAsFactory]**  | Factory for a contract: `getDefault()`, `get(string $key)`, `keys()`. Property type must be a Factory* interface. |

- **What** is injected is determined by the **property type** (the type hint).
- Only **protected** properties are considered. Constructor parameters are not used for DI (except for generated resolvers that receive implementations).

Example:

```php
#[AsServiceContract(of: HandlerInterface::class)]
final class MyHandler implements HandlerInterface
{
    #[InjectAsReadonly]
    protected LoggerInterface $logger;

    #[InjectAsMutable]
    protected ItemListProviderInterface $provider;

    #[InjectAsFactory]
    protected FactoryItemListProviderInterface $providerFactory;

    // Request/Session/Cookie: no attribute; injected from RequestContext into mutable clones
    protected Request $httpRequest;
    protected SessionInterface $session;
    protected CookieJarInterface $cookies;

    public function handle(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response): ResponseInterface
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Lifecycle

- **Build (once per worker):** All `AsServiceContract` classes are discovered; dependency graph is built from properties only; readonly instances and mutable prototypes are created. Mutable↔mutable cycles are forbidden and cause an exception.
- **Readonly:** One instance per type per worker; stored after build.
- **Mutable:** One prototype per type; each `get()` returns `clone(prototype)` then injects the current **RequestContext** (Request, Session, CookieJar) into the clone. No re-resolution of other dependencies on clone.

Request/Session/Cookie are **not** part of the normal dependency graph; they are provided per request via `RequestContext`. The application sets them on `RequestScopedContainer`; when all three are set, the container’s `RequestContext` is updated so that mutable services receive them after clone.

## Usage

```php
use Semitexa\Core\Container\ContainerFactory;

$container = ContainerFactory::get();
$service = $container->get(SomeInterface::class);  // or concrete class

$requestScoped = ContainerFactory::getRequestScoped();
$handler = $requestScoped->get(MyHandler::class);   // mutable: clone + RequestContext
```

## Resolvers and Factory*

- **Resolver (optional):** If `App\Registry\Contracts\{InterfaceShortName}Resolver` exists, the container uses it to get the active implementation; otherwise it uses the active implementation from the registry (module order).
- **Factory*:** For contracts with a Factory* interface (e.g. `FactoryItemListProviderInterface`), the container binds it either to a generated factory class (when present) or to a generic `ContractFactory` implementation. Inject the Factory* interface to use `getDefault()`, `get($key)`, `keys()`.

See **docs/SERVICE_CONTRACTS.md** for contracts, `contracts:list`, and resolver/factory conventions.

## Swoole

- Container is built once per worker.
- `RequestScopedContainer::reset()` is called after each request (e.g. in `server.php`) to clear request-scoped values and tenant context; the main container is not rebuilt.
- Readonly services are safe to keep; mutable services are cloned per request and receive the current RequestContext, so no leakage between requests.
