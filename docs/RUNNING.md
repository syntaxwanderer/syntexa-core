# Running Semitexa applications

The **only supported way** to run a Semitexa application is via **Docker**.

- **Start:** `bin/semitexa server:start` (runs `docker compose up -d`; with **EVENTS_ASYNC=1** in `.env` it uses `docker-compose.rabbitmq.yml` as well)
- **Stop:** `bin/semitexa server:stop` (runs `docker compose down`; if `docker-compose.rabbitmq.yml` exists, stops both app and RabbitMQ)
- **Logs:** `docker compose logs -f` (if you started with EVENTS_ASYNC=1, use: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rabbitmq.yml logs -f`)

The application runs `php server.php` inside the container; the Swoole server listens on port 9502 by default (configurable via `.env` `SWOOLE_PORT`). Do not run `php server.php` on the host as the primary way to run the app.

After `semitexa init`, the project includes a minimal `docker-compose.yml` (app only) and an optional `docker-compose.rabbitmq.yml`. By default only the **app** container runs, so there is no extra CPU load from RabbitMQ. When **EVENTS_ASYNC=1** in `.env`, `server:start` automatically uses both compose files so RabbitMQ is started and the app depends on it (with a relaxed healthcheck to avoid high CPU).

If you see "docker-compose.yml not found", run `semitexa init` to generate the project structure including `docker-compose.yml`, or add it manually.

## Twig template cache

Twig compiles templates into `var/cache/twig/`. When the app runs in Docker, that directory may be created with root ownership, so clearing it from the host can fail with "Permission denied". Options:

- **CLI (recommended):** `bin/semitexa cache:clear` — clears Twig and other framework caches. From inside the container: `docker compose exec app bin/semitexa cache:clear`.
- **From the host:** `sudo rm -rf var/cache/twig/*` (if the directory is root-owned).

The framework also uses a writable fallback (system temp) when `var/cache/twig` is not writable, so the app keeps working; clearing the cache is only needed when you change templates or template paths and want to avoid stale compiled files.
